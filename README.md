# iOS Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the iOS assignment provided by Radius Agent. The assignment involved creating a UI to display a list of facilities and their options, allowing users to select one option from each facility. Additionally, exclusions were implemented to prevent users from selecting certain combinations of options.

## Features

- Displaying a list of facilities and their options
- Single option selection for each facility
- Exclusion condition implementation to prevent invalid option combinations

## Design Pattern

For this assignment, I chose to use the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern. MVVM provides a clear separation of concerns and allows for easier testing and maintenance of the codebase. The main components of MVVM used in this project are:

- **Model**: Represents the data structure and API interactions.
- **View**: Displays the user interface and communicates with the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Contains the presentation logic, handles user interactions, and manages the data flow between the Model and the View.

## Third-Party Frameworks/Libraries

No Third-Party Frameworks/Libraries used.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.


2. Open the Xcode project file.

3. Build and run the project in the simulator or on a physical device.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can interact with the UI to select options from the list of facilities. The exclusions are automatically enforced, preventing you from selecting invalid combinations.

## Conclusion

The iOS assignment was successfully completed using the MVVM design pattern. The UI allows users to select options from facilities, and exclusions are implemented to prevent invalid selections.
